      Each year, almost 20 000 people die in Europe's roads in car accidents. Driver's distraction account for 20% of them. We propose to investigate the best 3D Driver Realtime Pose Estimation for action recognition purpose and understand car passengers needs. This is an opportunity for the automotive industry since driver and interior monitoring systems
      (DMS and IMS), which require the detailed understanding of cars’ passengers typically with a single camera, are gaining more importance every day. Systems that detect driver’s drowsiness or distraction are already deployed in numerous vehicles, and will continue to expand as new
      laws make them mandatory.

      What happens in the brain when humans perceive speech? We lay the ground for a new and expansive field of research aimed at reproducing human speech perception behaviour, by developing easy-to-use reference data and evaluation tools. In short, just as the past half-century has developed and tested thousands of speech perception experiments on human listeners, we develop a set of "speech perception experiments for machines," in order to find and close the gap between human and machine.
