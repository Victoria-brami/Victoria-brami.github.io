I am a Student in Machine Learning, just graduated from the ENS (Ecole Normale Supérieure) Paris-Saclay and Ecole des Ponts ParisTech with an MSc. in Applied Mathematics, Deep Learning and Computer Vision (**Master MVA**). 
Previously I have done various research internships in Computer Vision. The latest one was in Valeo.ai where I was supervised by [Patrick Perez](http://ptrckprz.github.io): my research focused on developping Driver Monitoring Sytems throuch the analysis of the driver with 3D Pose Estimation.
