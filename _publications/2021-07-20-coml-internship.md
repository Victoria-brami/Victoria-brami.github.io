abstract: What happens in the brain when humans perceive speech? We lay the ground for a new and expansive field of research aimed at reproducing human speech perception behaviour, by developing easy-to-use reference data and evaluation tools. In short, just as the past half-century has developed and tested thousands of speech perception experiments on human listeners, we develop a set of 'speech perception experiments for machines,' in order to find and close the gap between human and machine.
